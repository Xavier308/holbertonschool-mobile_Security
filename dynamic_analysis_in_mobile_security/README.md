# Dynamic Analysis in Mobile Security

Explore mobile app behavior at runtime using dynamic analysis tools like Frida, Objection, and Burp Suite. Learn to intercept, manipulate, and reverse engineer APKs to extract hidden flags and understand secure app development.

## Contents

This project includes:

* `Apk_task0`: Hook and modify app behavior to reveal a flag
* `Apk_task1`: Intercept native code (JNI) with Frida
* `Apk_task2`: Intercept and decrypt encrypted network traffic
* `Apk_task3`: Reveal hidden functions and extract secret data

## Tools Required

* Frida, Objection, ADB, GDB
* Burp Suite, mitmproxy, Wireshark
* APKTool, jadx
* Python

## Learning Objectives

* Understand dynamic vs. static analysis
* Hook native & Java functions at runtime
* Analyze cryptography in mobile apps
* Bypass SSL pinning & root detection
